## K-Means Clustering

### Description:
This Python script demonstrates the application of K-Means clustering on a dataset containing information about age and annual income. The dataset is visualized using a scatter plot, and the Elbow method is employed to determine the optimal number of clusters (k). The script then performs K-Means clustering and visualizes the resulting clusters.

### Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib

### Usage:
1. Install the required libraries using:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```

2. Run the script by executing:
   ```
   python kmeans_clustering.py
   ```

### Output:
The script generates a scatter plot of the dataset, an Elbow plot to determine the optimal k value, and a final scatter plot with clusters identified.

### Additional Notes:
- The dataset is loaded from a CSV file hosted on GitHub, and the script contains comments to guide you through each step.
- Normalization using MinMaxScaler is applied to the dataset before clustering.
- The Elbow method is used to find the optimal k value for clustering.

## Hierarchical Clustering

### Description:
This Python script demonstrates the application of Hierarchical Clustering on a randomly generated dataset. The script includes the creation of a distance matrix, visualization of the dendrogram, and the use of different linkage methods (average, complete, and single) for clustering.

### Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sklearn

### Usage:
1. Install the required libraries using:
   ```
   pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

2. Run the script by executing:
   ```
   python hierarchical_clustering.py
   ```

### Output:
The script generates a scatter plot of the randomly generated dataset, a distance matrix, and dendrograms for average, complete, and single linkage methods.

### Additional Notes:
- The dataset is randomly generated using the `make_blobs` function from scikit-learn.
- Different linkage methods are applied to observe their impact on cluster formation.
- The script includes comments to guide you through each step.
